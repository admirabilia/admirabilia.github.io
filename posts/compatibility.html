                <p>fantasizing about a parter with similar interests is not just romantic, but also parctical in my case. i'm in a phase of my life where i'm facing the fact that a life time is not enough to accomplish all my goals, build the knowledge i feel hungry for, experience all the art i feel drawn to.</p>
                <p>"I can never read all the books I want; I can never be all the people I want and live all the lives I want. I can never train myself in all the skills I want. And why do I want? I want to live and feel all the shades, tones and variations of mental and physical experience possible in my life. And I am horribly limited." -sylvia plath</p>
                <p>i, of course, try to see the beauty of this limitation and react to it with a strong motivation to not settle and push the bounderies of my realities by prioritizing meaningful experienses and by being "agentic" and aware of how my resources are allocated. i admit, nevertheless, that the weight of this conclusion is hard to bear sometimes.</p>
                <p>this being said, sharing interest with a partner is practical because i recognise the finiteness of my resources and i don't think i would be able to allocate the ammount that is required for the partnership to function if there is not some overlap of interests and passion.</p>
                <p>this framework of human connection is just the formalization of my empirical, personal experience. it is just how i found myself handling romantic relatioahips and i'm not saying that this is how i should interact, as a matter of fact, i have many doubts regarding this approach:</p>
                <p><li>where does the "not settling" end?</li>
                   <li>interests and passions may change over time, for both parts, for better or worse</li></p>
