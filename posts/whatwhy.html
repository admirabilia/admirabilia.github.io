                <h3>What and Why</h3>
                <div class="post-date"><i>August 13, 2025</i></div>
                <p>this post should have been the first one since i will dive in (no LMM here, trust me)
                   ... ok let's say 'get into' what and why i want to write about.
                </p>
                <h4>What</h4>
                <p>Everything. i already have some subjects i would like to learn about. remember the
                   'learn' part. some of the next posts may be about consciousness, or something like that.
                   idk.
                </p>
                <h4>Why</h4>
                <p>why not? just kidding. remember the 'learn' part? i want to write to learn. 
                   i don't know why but i think writing makes my thinking clear 
                   and structured. great link between the paragraphs, right? i know, thanks.
                </p>
                <p> here's a bonus:</p>
                <h4>How</h4>
                <p>as you can see, or read, i don't want my writing (and as a consequence, the learning)
                   to be inhibited by structure and conventions. i write as if i'm talking to a friend or 
                   sending them a message. sometimes i will make an effort to write capital letters.
                   i care more about punctuation than capitalization, and commas are the queens.
                </p>
                <p>that's it, if you know more about a subject i write about, which is 97.3267% possible
                   since i have very cool friends, i would love to talk about it! if you get here, you either
                   have my contact somewhere (twitter wink-wink), or you know a friend of a friend of a friend of mine.
